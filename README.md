# Why?
When I was in high school, I used to struggle with managing my work, but not time management. Hence, I always felt overwhelmed which strongly affected my daily routine and healthy lifestyle. I first learned how to categorize my work according to its importance, concentrating on the easy tasks to maximize my time. I learned to identify my importance and urgency. While tutoring at the learning center in the university, I met a lot of peers who also struggle with work management instead of time management. Therefore, I created ZGoalizt to help Gen Z optimize their productivity in learning and working by having a thorough plan to manage their workload.
